OSTAROS - Archive OS and install it back
========================================

Installation Instructions
=========================

OSTAROS consists of two bash scripts:
  * os2tar.sh - creating an image of existing OS installation
  * tar2os.sh - making a new OS installation from an existing image

Running them was tested on SystemRescueCd versions from 4.2.0 to 4.8.3
<http://www.system-rescue-cd.org/>, though they should work on most
GNU/Linux live CDs with appropriate system tools included.

Noteworthy dependencies of the installer script are:
  * tar
  * gzip
  * whiptail
  * parted
  * pv
  * setcap

Current installer script limitations:
  * only MBR partitioning is supported
  * only Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04 and derivatives are supported
  * making installations of Debian GNU/Linux 7, 8 and 9 should work
    but it was not tested extensively
  * image can be prepared from OS installation with separate root,
    home and swap partitions

Noteworthy dependencies of the image creation script are:
  * tar
  * gzip
  * getcap
  * getfacl
  * lsattr
  * ssh client on machine where OS image will be stored
  * ssh server on machine with OS installation to be archived

The image creation script is non-interactive and does not accept any
command-line options. Partitions of existing OS installation are
supposed to be specified inside os2tar.sh script. Look inside it for
details.

The installer script is interactive and wizard-driven. It searches for
OS images in specific locations that are currently specified inside
tar2os.sh script. Look inside it for details.

To automatically run the installer script right after booting of
SystemRescueCd just rename tar2os.sh to autorun and place it in root
of SystemRescueCd filesystem hierarchy (therefore you should modify
iso image before burning it or put file on the appropriate partition of
SystemRescueCd usb stick).
